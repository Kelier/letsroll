### Look This

that's my first npm package.

它用jS进行构造简单的滑动效果，我已经在项目里添加了demo文件

you can download or clone or use `npm install letsroll`

which included:

 - 匀速直线运动
 - 匀加速直线运动
 - 匀减速曲线运动
 
I use my leisure time to abstract a function from the code in the previous business, so you can use it easily.

But its function is still chicken ribs, and I hope to make more suggestions and update it.

Thanks~ 🙊
